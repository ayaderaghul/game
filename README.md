# abstract

input payoff matrix
output a report that includes:

# logs

21-3-17: start

7-5: 3 person game

10-5: 

(combine-payoffs B B B)

((...) (...))
((...) (...))

for a second, i see the matrix as on paper (top -> down)
but in code, the matrix is represented left -> right

thought there was a bug, but the code actually works fine
